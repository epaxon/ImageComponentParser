Image Component Parser is a Matlab GUI for automated analysis of Voltage and Calcium imaging data.

The primary function of ICP is to decompose imaging data into independent components using PCA and ICA. This procedure consists of 4 stages:
1. Preprocessing on the Data - blur, down sample, filter
2. Principle Components Analysis
3. Indpendent Compnents Analysis
4. Post processing - segmentation, ROI generation, and clustering.
